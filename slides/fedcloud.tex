        EGI Federated Cloud is based on:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Standards and validation: federation is based on common
            Open-Standards â€“ OCCI, CDMI, OVF, GLUE, etc...
            \item Heterogeneous implementation: no mandate on the cloud
            technology, the only condition is to expose the chosen
            interfaces and services.
        \end{itemize}
